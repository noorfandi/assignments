        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Here at ForestMatters we do our best to reduce deforestation and restore natural habitat by planting trees and maintaining current forests.
            Protecting our planet is a serious business, and to ensure that we all have a bright future, we need your help to achieve our mission.
        </p>

                Join as a volunteer and decide how you could help. We usually need volunteers for the physical work — digging, planting — and also we need people to organize events.
                We need all the help we can get, so if you want to volunteer and help in a different way, we are happy to hear your suggestions.

                We accept donations to support our continuous work. We have a lot of different expenses to cover, and as a donor you could pick which line of work you would like to support.
                Every penny counts and is used for our cause. Our transparency is important, so we publish detailed reports of our expenses all the time.
